# vim-styled-components

Vim bundle for [styled-components](https://styled-components.com), [diet-cola](https://github.com/jxnblk/diet-cola) and experimental [glamor/styled](https://github.com/threepointone/glamor/blob/master/docs/styled.md) based javascript files.

This plugin checks, whether the current buffer contains an `import` or a `require` from `styled-components`, `diet-cola` or `glamor/styled` and injects CSS rules into JS template strings.

Note however, that this plugin does not provide its own CSS rules. You should have an up to date vim runtime (for CSS2 rules) and - as long as CSS3 rules are not included - an additional plugin for CSS3 rules. (I recommend [hail2u/vim-css3-syntax](https://github.com/hail2u/vim-css3-syntax) but feel free to use whatever you like.)

**Note:** This plugin won't change the syntax if you start with an empty buffer and then add styled-components code, you will need to close the buffer and re-open it so that the styles apply.

A quick way to do that is with this command: `:edit!` which will do exactly that. You can map that to a shortcut if you wish.
